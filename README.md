<h1>Recipe-API-project</h1>

<h3>General Info<h3>
<hr>
  <p>
    Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the <a href="https://recipesapi.herokuapp.com/">herokuapp recipe</a> API to fetch and display recipe food data.
    It uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6 back to ES5 to allow old browsers to understand ES6 syntax.
    It also makes use of Webpack-dev-server to launch the app.

    The project was created as part of <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> Javascript course on udemy.
